# ostc-docs

Documentation for the Open Source Technology Center (OSTC) team.

Please note that this is a public repository, and I'd like to keep it
public so other public repositories can refer to sections of this
repository. This avoids duplication of documentation, which helps
avoids repository documentation becoming stale over time.

Experience dictates that this repository is useful for multiple
groups. To maintain this, the very first section, Infrastructure
Information, is dedicated to OSTC-specific information. All other
sections are intended to be generally useful for everyone.

Please keep this in mind when adding documentation to this repository.
